# SMS Spam Classifier

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://g114064015lab-aiot-da-hw3-app-qw62t5.streamlit.app)

A simple but effective spam classifier using scikit-learn. Includes preprocessing, model training, and inference capabilities.

üîó **Try it now:** [SMS Spam Classifier Web App](https://g114064015lab-aiot-da-hw3-app-qw62t5.streamlit.app)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train baseline model (saves to models/final_model.pkl)
python main.py

# Start the web UI
streamlit run app.py

# Or make predictions from command line
python scripts/predict.py --message "WINNER!! You have won ¬£1000, call now to claim!"
```

## Web Interface

The project includes a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit. To use it:

1. Make sure you've trained the model first using `python main.py`
2. Run `streamlit run app.py`
3. Open your browser to the URL shown (usually http://localhost:8501)
4. Enter any SMS message to test the classifier!

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Dataset storage
  - `sms_spam_no_header.csv` - Raw dataset (downloaded on first run)
- `src/` - Source code
  - `preprocess.py` - Text cleaning and feature extraction
  - `train.py` - Model training utilities
- `scripts/` - Command-line tools
  - `predict.py` - Make predictions with trained model
- `models/` - Saved model artifacts
  - `final_model.pkl` - Trained pipeline (created after training)
- `main.py` - End-to-end training script
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Training

The default training script (`main.py`) uses:
- TF-IDF vectorization with word bigrams
- Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
- 80/20 train/test split

For more options:
```bash
python main.py --help
```

## Making Predictions

Use `scripts/predict.py` to classify new messages:

```bash
# Single message
python scripts/predict.py --message "Your message here"

# Multiple messages from file
python scripts/predict.py --input-file messages.txt --output-file predictions.csv
```

## Development

To run with debug logging:
```bash
python run_main_debug.py  # Saves logs to run.log
```

## Testing

Run the test suite with:
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=src/
```

Tests include:
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training and evaluation
- End-to-end pipeline validation

## Live Demo
